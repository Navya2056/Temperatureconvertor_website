# Temperatureconvertor_website
The project you provided appears to be a web-based temperature converter. Here's a brief explanation of its key features:

Title and Background Image: The web page has a title "Temperature Converter," and it uses a background image (specified in the CSS) to create an attractive visual backdrop for the content.

Main Container: The content is centered within a container that covers the entire viewport height (100vh). The container uses a flexbox layout to align its content both vertically and horizontally, making it visually appealing.

Heading: The page contains a heading within the main container, emphasizing the purpose of the page.

Temperature Converter Section: The core of the project is the "converter-row" section. This section is styled with a gradient background, rounded corners, and a shadow, giving it a distinct visual appearance.

Columns: Within the "converter-row," there are three columns arranged vertically, each responsible for a different temperature unit (Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin).

Labels and Input Fields: Each column includes a label and an input field. The label provides information about the expected temperature unit, while the input field allows the user to enter a temperature value.

Input Field Styling: The input fields are styled to have a white background, rounded corners, and text centered within them.

The primary functionality of this web page is to allow users to input a temperature value in any of the three units (Fahrenheit, Celsius, or Kelvin), and the page should ideally provide real-time conversions to the other two units as the user enters a value.

While the provided code contains the styling for the web page, it lacks the JavaScript logic necessary to perform the temperature conversions. You would need to implement JavaScript to make this temperature converter functional by adding logic to convert temperature values between the different units based on user input.

In summary, this project aims to create a visually appealing and functional temperature converter web page, but the conversion logic itself is not included in the code you provided.
